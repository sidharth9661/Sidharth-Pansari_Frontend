### The issues in the provided code listed as bullet points for clarity:

1. The PropTypes of the components are defined using the prop-types package, but the items prop in the WrappedListComponent component is defined incorrectly using the array function, which is not valid.
2. In the SingleListItem component, the isSelected prop is assigned to the backgroundColor style as an object, but it should be a boolean value instead.
3. The onClickHandler prop in the SingleListItem component is not called correctly, requiring it to be passed as a function reference instead of a function call.
3. The index prop in the SingleListItem component is not marked as required in the propTypes, which can lead to issues.
4. The setSelectedIndex state in the WrappedListComponent component is incorrectly defined as a setter function, when it should be defined using the useState hook instead.

#### Fixing these issues should help ensure the code runs as expected and reduces the chance of runtime errors or warnings.
